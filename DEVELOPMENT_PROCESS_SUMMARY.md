## üö® Major Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Infinite Blue Loop on Android 14

**Problem:** App showed infinite loading loop on Android 14 device (UP1A.231005.007)

**Root Cause Analysis:**

- Expo Go compatibility issues with Android 14
- Complex state management causing render loops
- Native module conflicts

**Solution Strategy:**

1. **Incremental Feature Testing**

   - Started with minimal "Hello World" app
   - Added features one by one to isolate issues
   - Identified that core React Native worked fine

2. **Development Build Approach**
   - Switched from Expo Go to development build
   - Used `npx expo run:android` for direct device deployment
   - Bypassed Expo Go compatibility issues

**Result:** Successfully resolved infinite loop by using development build instead of Expo Go

### Challenge 2: Environment Variables Setup

**Problem:** Android build failed with JAVA_HOME and ANDROID_HOME errors

**Error Messages:**

```
ERROR: JAVA_HOME is not set
SDK location not found. Define a valid SDK location with an ANDROID_HOME environment variable
```

**Solution:**

1. **Java Installation Verification**

   - Confirmed Java JDK 17 installation
   - Located Java installation path

2. **Android SDK Configuration**

   - Located Android SDK in AppData\Local\Android\Sdk
   - Set ANDROID_HOME environment variable
   - Added SDK tools to PATH

3. **PowerShell Session Configuration**
   ```powershell
   $env:JAVA_HOME = "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17"
   $env:ANDROID_HOME = "C:\Users\fajea\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk"
   ```

**Result:** Successfully built and deployed Android app to physical device

### Challenge 3: Native Module Dependencies

**Problem:** expo-device, expo-location, expo-notifications modules not found

**Error Messages:**

```
Unable to resolve "expo-device" from "config\notifications.js"
Error: Cannot find native module 'ExpoDevice'
```

**Root Cause:** Development build didn't include newly installed native modules

**Solution Strategy:**

1. **Package Installation**

   ```bash
   npm install expo-location expo-notifications expo-device @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
   ```

2. **Simplified Implementation**

   - Created mock implementations for immediate testing
   - Used console logging instead of native notifications
   - Implemented mock location data (Atlanta, GA)

3. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - App works with simplified features
   - Native modules can be fully integrated in future builds

**Result:** App runs successfully with core functionality and mock exceptional features

### Challenge 4: Weather API Configuration

**Problem:** Weather API showing "Weather API not configured"

**Solution:**

1. **API Key Integration**

   - Obtained OpenWeatherMap API key: 8be5144592c3d90ecfb249e32f0ae8b6
   - Updated weather configuration file
   - Added comprehensive error logging

2. **Error Handling Enhancement**
   - Added detailed API response logging
   - Implemented graceful fallback for API failures
   - Added API key validation

**Result:** Weather API configured with proper error handling and logging
