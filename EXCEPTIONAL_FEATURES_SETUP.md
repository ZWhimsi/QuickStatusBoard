# Exceptional Features Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the exceptional features for the Quick Status Board app.

## 1. Weather API Integration

### Setup OpenWeatherMap API

1. Go to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Get your API key from the dashboard
4. Open `config/weather.js`
5. Replace `your-openweathermap-api-key-here` with your actual API key:

```javascript
const WEATHER_API_KEY = 'your-actual-api-key-here';
```

### Usage

The weather feature will automatically fetch current weather conditions when posting a status (if enabled). It will display:
- Temperature in Celsius
- Weather description (e.g., "clear sky", "light rain")
- Weather emoji
- City name

## 2. Location Services

### Setup

Location services are already configured with Expo Location. The app will:

1. Request location permissions when first used
2. Get current GPS coordinates
3. Reverse geocode to get city/region information
4. Display location in status posts

### Permissions

The app will automatically request location permissions. Users can:
- Grant permission to include location in posts
- Deny permission (location features will be disabled)

## 3. Push Notifications

### Setup Expo Push Notifications

1. Go to [Expo Dashboard](https://expo.dev/)
2. Create a new project or use existing one
3. Get your project ID
4. Open `config/notifications.js`
5. Replace `your-expo-project-id` with your actual project ID:

```javascript
const token = await Notifications.getExpoPushTokenAsync({
  projectId: 'your-actual-expo-project-id',
});
```

### Features

- Local notifications when posting status
- Push notifications to partners (requires backend setup)
- Notification permissions handling

## 4. Enabling Enhanced Features

To use the enhanced version of the app with all exceptional features:

1. Replace the import in `App.js`:

```javascript
// Change this line:
import FeedScreen from './screens/FeedScreen';

// To this:
import FeedScreen from './screens/EnhancedFeedScreen';
```

2. The enhanced screen includes:
   - Toggle switches for location and weather
   - Automatic feature integration
   - Enhanced status display

## 5. Testing the Features

### Weather API Testing

1. Enable weather toggle in the app
2. Post a status
3. Check that weather information appears in the post

### Location Testing

1. Enable location toggle in the app
2. Grant location permissions when prompted
3. Post a status
4. Check that location information appears in the post

### Notifications Testing

1. Grant notification permissions when prompted
2. Post a status
3. Check that a local notification appears

## 6. API Limits and Considerations

### OpenWeatherMap Free Tier

- 1,000 API calls per day
- 60 calls per minute
- Sufficient for development and testing

### Location Services

- Uses device GPS
- Requires internet connection for reverse geocoding
- Battery usage considerations for frequent location requests

### Push Notifications

- Free tier available through Expo
- Requires physical device for testing
- Simulator/emulator has limited notification support

## 7. Troubleshooting

### Weather API Issues

- Verify API key is correct
- Check internet connection
- Ensure API key has proper permissions

### Location Issues

- Check device location permissions
- Ensure location services are enabled
- Test on physical device (emulator may have issues)

### Notification Issues

- Test on physical device
- Check notification permissions
- Verify Expo project ID is correct

## 8. Production Considerations

### Security

- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement proper error handling

### Performance

- Cache weather data to reduce API calls
- Implement location caching
- Optimize notification frequency

### User Experience

- Provide clear permission explanations
- Handle offline scenarios gracefully
- Implement proper loading states

## 9. Next Steps

After setting up the exceptional features:

1. Test all features thoroughly
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Add user preferences for feature toggles
4. Consider implementing push notifications to partners
5. Add more weather data (forecast, alerts)
6. Implement location-based features (nearby users, etc.)

## 10. Assignment Compliance

These exceptional features fulfill the assignment requirements:

✅ **User Authentication**: Firebase Authentication implemented  
✅ **3rd-party Data**: OpenWeatherMap API integration  
✅ **Native Features**: Location services and push notifications  
✅ **Real-time Updates**: Firestore real-time listeners  
✅ **Partner Collaboration**: Git repository with shared codebase  

The app now includes all required features plus exceptional enhancements that demonstrate advanced mobile development capabilities.
